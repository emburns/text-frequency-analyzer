Space is the vast, mostly empty expanse that exists beyond Earth's atmosphere, stretching infinitely in all directions. It's where all celestial objects like stars, planets, galaxies, and cosmic phenomena exist.

**What makes space unique:**
Space is characterized by an almost perfect vacuum - there's virtually no matter between objects. This creates conditions radically different from Earth: no air to breathe, extreme temperatures that can swing from hundreds of degrees above zero near stars to just a few degrees above absolute zero in the void, and no atmospheric pressure.

**Scale and structure:**
The universe operates on mind-boggling scales. Our solar system, which seems enormous to us, is just a tiny speck in the Milky Way galaxy, which contains roughly 100-400 billion stars. The Milky Way itself is one of potentially trillions of galaxies in the observable universe. Light from distant galaxies has been traveling for billions of years to reach us.

**Key components:**
Stars are massive nuclear fusion reactors that create and distribute the elements necessary for planets and life. Planets form from the leftover material in stellar nurseries. Black holes are regions where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. Dark matter and dark energy make up about 95% of the universe, yet we can't directly observe them.

**Space exploration:**
Humans have been exploring space for less than 70 years, starting with artificial satellites in the 1950s. We've walked on the Moon, sent robotic probes throughout the solar system, and built space stations. Today, we're planning missions to Mars and developing technologies for deeper space exploration.
